##### Under construction ######
I will provide two implementations of the same algorithm. The python verson is simplier to use and is used generally during the prototyping stage of Deep Optimisation. As such it records alot of statistics during the optimisation process which is great for understanding what DO is doing under the hood.

Deep optimisation is implemented using tensorflow. 

The python implemetation is slow

c++ Version:
Contents will include the neccesary code to reproduce the results obtained by the deep optimisation algorithm.
